# Content-Based-Recommendation-System
The movie recommendation system successfully generates personalized recommendations for users based on their input movie titles. Users can input a movie title into the GUI interface, and the system provides a list of recommended movies that are similar in content to the input movie. The recommendations are displayed in real-time on the GUI, allowing users to explore and discover new movies that align with their preferences.

# Dataset
I used a dataset of 5000 movies; the link is provided below:

I used the 'overview' column of the movies.csv file to compare the movies and calculate the f1 scores and recommend movies with highest f1 scores (similarity). The movie recommendation system successfully leverages advanced techniques such as TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to generate personalized recommendations for users. By analysing the textual content of movie overviews and computing similarity scores, the system identifies movies with similar themes, genres, and plot elements to the input movie, thereby enhancing user engagement and satisfaction.
